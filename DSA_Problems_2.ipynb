    "### Problem 1 : Loading CSV Data (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with how to load data. In this problem, you will load the ```enron_employees.csv``` file provided with this assignment. (A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a text file that contains data 'delimited' by a character into separate values. When read by a program, these files can be easily converted into simple spreadsheets and can be read and edited by popular spreadsheet processing programs like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. Since CSV files are simple to load and do not require specialized commercial software for usage, they are extremely popular as a data-distribution format.)\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: When row numbers are mentioned below, they start from 1 as you would generally see in spreadsheet software like Calc or Excel. Please do not forget that Python uses zero-based indexing (indices start from 0 instead of 1).\n",

    "In this assignment, you will use the csv library to load CSV files. The code for reading a csv file using the csv library is as follows.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('path/to/your/file', 'r', encoding=\"utf8\") as rf:\n",
    "\treader = csv.reader(rf, delimiter = ',')\n",
    "\tfor row in reader:\n",
    "\t\tprint(row) # row represents a single row of data from the CSV file. csv.reader reads the file line by line, and each row is stored as a list where each element corresponds to a cell in that row.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " In this problem, you will implement a function named ```load_data(filepath)``` that first read the provided csv file and return the header and data. Header is a first row of the csv file and data contains everything from row 2 onwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the function will be called by ```load_data('path/to/your/file')```. The header and data should be return in the format of two lists, i.e., ```['from', 'to', 'timestamp'], [['48', '13', '926389620'], ['67', '13', '926418960'], ['67', '13', '926418960'], ['75', '147', '926430480'], ['67', '48', '926498640']]```."

    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will implement a function `format_timestamp(header, data)` that takes header, data as inputs. The function should convert the Unix timestamp of each row to a more readable date format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. This more readable form of the timestamp will be appended to each row. The header should also be updated to add a column name `timestamp_formated`. The updated header and data should be returned.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "unix_timestamp = int('939019080')\n",
    "readable_timestamp = datetime.fromtimestamp(unix_timestamp).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the function will be called by ```format_timestamp(header, data)```. The updated header (```['from', 'to', 'timestamp', 'time']```) and formatted data (```[['48', '13', '926389620', '1999-05-11 02:27:00'], ['67', '13', '926418960', '1999-05-11 10:36:00'], ['67', '13', '926418960', '1999-05-11 10:36:00'], ... , ['137', '49', '949312440', '2000-01-31 09:54:00']]```) should be returned."

Then, we create a loop to iterate over each index of the range of the length of the data. Through indexing, we access the third element (index 2) of the i-th row. Then, we append the formatted timestamp for each index to each row in the data. We finally create a new object called `formatted_data`, which is equal to data. We do this to rename the data, as we are required to return it as formatted_data. "
