    "## Problem 2: Automatic Detection and Correction of Fused Mathematical Expressions [3 Points]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fused Mathematical Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been hired by MathCorrector, a company specializing in developing tools to automatically detect and correct specific errors in mathematical expressions. This task focuses on errors where multiplication operators between numbers and variables are missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance\n",
    "- `2x + 5y` should be converted to `2 * x + 5 * y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, the input will only contaion variables(**consisting of a single letter**), integer of any digit, and basic arithmetic operators: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and equal (`=`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the expression easier to read, you are also required to format the expression to ensure consistent spacing between operators and operands. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "- `2*x+ 5*y` should be `2 * x + 5 * y`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that the input expression is correct except for the problems mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Three functions are desiged to handle problmes metioned above. In this problem, we will implement theses three functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **detect_fused_tokens(expr)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Detect where multiplication is missing between numbers and variables.\n",
    "   - **Input**: A string `expr` representing the mathematical expression.\n",
    "   - **Process**: Identify substrings where numbers are directly followed by variables without an operator (such as `2x`).\n",
    "   - **Output**: Return a list of substrings where multiplication is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **insert_multiplication(expr, fused_tokens)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Insert multiplication operators in the correct positions identified by the `detect_fused_tokens` function.\n",
    "   - **Input**: A string `expr` representing the mathematical expression, and a list `fused_tokens` from the `detect_fused_tokens` function.\n",
    "   - **Process**: Add multiplication operators between numbers and variables in the substrings identified by the `fused_tokens`.\n",
    "   - **Output**: Return the modified expression with the appropriate multiplication operators inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **format_expression(expr)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Format the expression to ensure consistent spacing between operators and operands, making the expression easier to read.\n",
    "   - **Input**: The expression processed by the `insert_multiplication` function.\n",
    "   - **Process**: Ensure appropriate spacing between all operators and operands.\n",
    "   - **Output**: Return the formatted mathematical expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input `2x+ 5y - 3zw`:\n",
    "- The `detect_fused_tokens` function will detect the missing multiplication operators and return relevant information (e.g., `['2x', '5y', '3zw']`).\n",
    "- The `insert_multiplication` function will process the expression and convert it to `2*x+ 5*y - 3*z*w`.\n",
