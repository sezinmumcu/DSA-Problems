    "### Recursive Route Planner ###\n",
    "\n",
    "You've been selected for an internship at TomTom and as a part of your first project, you have been asked to design the core functionality for a route planner that computes the path between two points in a city. TomTom stores top-down 2D views of a city in a 2D Numpy array. An example layout for a city is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "city_map = np.array([[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ],\n",
    "[ 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ],\n",
    "[ 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ],\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this map, locations marked with ‘1’ represents empty-spaces whereas ‘0’ represent buildings. Your task is to code a solution that computes a driving route via empty spaces from one end of the city to the other subject to the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drivers always start from an empty-space in the extreme left column (```city_map[:,0]```) and always terminate their journey in the column on the extreme right (```city_map[:,-1]```).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They never revisit a location they’ve already passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Drivers do not move diagonally.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Locations directly above, below, left and right of a building are their designated parking spots. Drivers cannot drive through these locations (they cannot be used for the path).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Drivers are not concerned about the distance. All valid paths are admissible as a solution irrespective of their length.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a city map, mark locations directly above, below, left and right of a building as blocked (remember, they are parking locations for the building and cannot be used for the route). Save this transformed map in a second map called\n",
    "```marked_city_map```.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you have a ```marked_city_map```, you will start from a location in the left-most column. Before moving into a new location, you must check if it is blocked (note that you cannot stand at a location of a building or parking). Once you move into an unblocked spot, you can then look again in four possible directions (up, down, left, right) to see if you can move there.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You must implement the above procedure using a **recursive** function that takes a step in all unblocked directions and checks if it can then repeat this again. It recursively repeats this till it reaches the final column.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can break this into the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [1 point] Write a function ```mark_parking_locations()``` takes a 2D Numpy array ```city_map``` as an argument and converts it to a ```marked_city_map``` by marking all parking locations. You should mark parking locations with -1 in your Numpy array.\n",

    "For the second function, we use three arguments: `route_map`, `current_loc`, and `visited_locs`. We unpack current location tuple to enable manipulation of a specific position, and store it as `current_loc`. Then, through the .shape, we return a tuple that contains the the number of rows and columns of the route map array, and we store them as `rows` and `cols`. Again, we do this to enable manipulation of a specific row/ column at a specific location. \n",

    "We first check if the current column is the last column of the route map. We do it because the goal of our algorithm is to navigate from the leftmost column to any location in the rightmost column. Hence, if y = cols - 1, it means that the algorithm has successfully reached the last column, which indicates a successful path has been found. Therefore, no need to continue, we just return the `route_map`. We add this check in the very beginning, because although it won't be used or relevant for the first execution of the code, it will be useful for the other executions, as our code includes recursion. This part of the code will disable recursion running forever. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we mark the current location on the route map as visited. Here, the  x and y refer to the current row and column of the location being processed. By setting `route_map[x, y]` to 1, we indicate that this position has been explored and is no longer available for further movement in the current search path. Then, we add the current location to the visited locations list. This list keeps track of all locations that have been visited during the current search path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of the code defines the potential directions our algorithm can move from the current location. We represent each move as a tuple containing: the new x-coordinate after the move (new_x), the new y-coordinate after the move (new_y), a direction code that indicates the type of movement. For example, `Move Right` means we stay at the same row x but move to the next column y + 1, and the direction code 40 indicates that the move is to the right. `Move Down` means we move down one row to x + 1 while staying in the same column y, and the direction code 20 indicates that the move is downward. `Move Left` means we stay in the same row x but move to the previous column y - 1, and the direction code 30 indicates that the move is to the left. Finally, `Move Up` means we move up one row to x - 1 while staying in the same column y, and the direction code 10 indicates that the move is upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then iterate through each possible move. First, we check if the new position is valid. Meaning, if the new x-coordinate is within the range of valid rows and the new y-coordinate is within the range of valid columns. Then, we check ifhe new position is an empty space and if it has not been visited yet. If both of these conditions are trure, we found a new position! We mark it with it's corresponding direction code, to indicate how we arrived here (left, right, up, or down). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we use recursion to repeat all these on the new possible locations. Specifically, when we call the recursive function it tries to explore further paths from a new position. If that exploration leads to successfully reaching the last column of the route map, the function will return the updated route map with the path marked. If no valid path is found from the new position, find route will return None. Hence,\n",
    "the line return result will be executed only if a valid route is found. We will then immediately return the successful path (the updated route map) back to the previous call in the recursion stack. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if there is no possible route, then we reset the current location back to 1, to make it available for future moves. We also remove it from the visited locations list. By doing so, we allow other potential paths to explore it again in future searches. Finally, we return `None` as we could not find a valid route from the current location. "
