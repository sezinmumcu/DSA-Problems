    "Travel agents work with various planning applications to get real-time travel information to serve their clients. In this assignment, you will build a complete product that will offer travel agents the ability to add, delete and update railway travel information for several railway stations in the country (Netherlands), while still being able to view complex connections with a single command. You will be storing this information in a graph. A graph is composed of nodes (vertices) connected with edges. The nodes in our problem are railway stations, while the edges are railway connections between them.\n",

    "1. The ```RailwayStation``` class stores attributes commonly associated with railway stations (e.g. railway station name, railway station code, inbound and outbound connections) in a single place.\n",

    "For the first problem, we start with `__init___` to intialise the data attributes. We assign the provided `railway_station_name` and `railway_station_code` to instance variables of the same names. Then, we create an empty set to store inbound connections. We use a set because it prevents duplicate entries and it is easy to make additions or removals of connections.\n",

    "\n",
    "We then define a property getter. We use `@property` build-in function, as implemented here: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/property With this function, we transform the railway_station_code method into a \"getter\" for a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we introduce the `railway_station_code.setter` decorator to indicate that this method is the setter for the `railway_station_code` property. With this setter, we aim to ensure that the `railway_station_code` always adheres to the specified format (3-4 alphabetic characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define the remaining methods: `set_inbound_connection`, `delete_inbound_connection`, `set_outbound_connection`, `delete_outbound_connection`. We use `add()` and `discard()` methods for the first two. With the third method, we add or update an outbound connection from the current railway station to another station, along with the ticket price for that connection. In the fourth method we use the `pop()` method. We remove an existing outbound connection from the current railway station to another station, and return `None` if the key is not found in the dictionary."
